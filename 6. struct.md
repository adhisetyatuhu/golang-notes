# 1. Struct
A struct is a composite data type that groups together fields (variables) under 
a single type. It is used to represent real-world entities with multiple attributes.

```go
type Car struct {
	Merk     string
	Year    int
	Color string
}
```


## Struct Embedding
Go supports struct embedding, which allows one struct to include another struct. 
This is a way to achieve composition.

```go
type ElectricCar struct {
    Car          // Embedding the Car struct
    ChargerType string
}
```
> **Embedding**: The `ElectricCar` struct embeds the `Car` struct, inheriting its
> fields (`Merk`, `Year`, `Color`) and methods.  
> **Additional Field**: `ElectricCar` adds a new field, `ChargerType`, specific to
> electric cars.  

<br />

# 2. Method
A method is a function associated with a specific type (e.g., a struct). Methods allow 
you to define behavior for structs.

## Value Receiver
A method with a value receiver operates on a copy of the struct. It cannot modify the 
original struct.
```go
func (c Car) getMerk() string {
    return c.Merk
}
```
> **Receiver**: `(c Car)` means the method is associated with the `Car` struct.  
> **Purpose**: The `getMerk` method returns the `Merk` (brand) of the car.  
> **Limitation**: Since it uses a value receiver, it cannot modify the original `Car` struct.

## Pointer Receiver
A method with a pointer receiver operates on the original struct. It can modify the struct's fields.

```go
func (c *Car) setMerk(merk string) {
    c.Merk = merk
}
```
> **Receiver**: `(c *Car)` means the method operates on a pointer to the `Car` struct.  
> **Purpose**: The `setMerk` method updates the `Merk` (brand) of the car.  
> **Advantage**: Using a pointer receiver allows the method to modify the original struct.

<br />

# 3. Using Structs and Methods
### Creating an Instance
```go
myCar := ElectricCar{
    Car: Car{
        Merk:  "Honda",
        Year:  2025,
        Color: "Red",
    },
    ChargerType: "Type 1",
}
```
> **Instance**: myCar is an instance of the `ElectricCar` struct.  
> **Initialization**: The `Car` struct is initialized with `Merk`, `Year`, and `Color`.
> The `ElectricCar` struct adds `ChargerType`.

### Accessing Fields
```go
fmt.Println(myCar.Merk)
fmt.Println(myCar.Year)
```

### Calling Methods
```go
myCar.setMerk("Toyota")
fmt.Println(myCar.getMerk())
```

# Key Points
**Structs**:
+ Used to group related data.
+ Fields can be accessed and modified directly or through methods.

**Methods**:
+ Value Receiver: Operates on a copy of the struct (read-only).
+ Pointer Receiver: Operates on the original struct (can modify fields).

**Struct Embedding**:
+ Allows one struct to inherit fields and methods from another struct.
